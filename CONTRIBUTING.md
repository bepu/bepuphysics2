## Reporting a bug?
Use the issues tab on github. If possible, include a simple reproduction of the bug, like a snippet that triggers the bug in the demos application.

## Want to ask a question?
The [discussion board](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2/discussions) is the primary place to ask questions, especially longer ones that require more context. You may want to also try searching the archived [forum](https://forum.bepuentertainment.com/).

For quicker questions and chitchat, there's a [discord](https://discord.gg/ssa2XpY).

## Want to contribute directly?
The project does take pull requests, but for bigger changes, I strongly recommend getting in touch ahead of time.

The project is primarily driven and shaped by my own requirements and internal projects. That has two main consequences: 
1. There's a pretty good chance that something I'm doing internally could step on your toes.
2. Some contributions might not fit with where I want to take the project, or they would introduce code that I don't want to maintain in the long term.

To avoid nasty surprises that result in the rejection of a big PR, contact me early here on github, in the [discussions](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2/discussions), on [discord](https://discord.gg/ssa2XpY), or even [tweetertown](https://twitter.com/RossNordby).
