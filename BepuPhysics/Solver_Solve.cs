        //This is going to look a bit more complicated than would be expected for a series of forloops.
        //A naive implementation would look something like:
        //1) PRESTEP: Parallel dispatch over all constraints, regardless of batch. (Presteps do not write shared data, so there is no need to redispatch per-batch.)
        //2) WARMSTART: Loop over all constraint batches, parallel dispatch over all constraints in batch. (Warmstarts read and write velocities, so batch borders must be respected.)
        //3) SOLVE ITERATIONS: Loop over iterations, loop over all constraint batches, parallel dispatch over all constraints in batch. (Solve iterations also read/write.) 

        //There are a few problems with this approach:
        //1) Fork-join dispatches are not free. Expect ~2us overhead on the main thread for each one, regardless of the workload.
        //If there are 10 constraint batches and 10 iterations, you're up to 1 + 10 + 10 * 10 = 111 dispatches. Over a fifth of a millisecond in pure overhead.
        //This is just a byproduct of general purpose dispatchers not being able to make use of extremely fine grained application knowledge.
        //Every dispatch has to get the threads rolling and scheduled, then the threads have to figure out when to go back into a blocked state
        //when no more work is unavailable, and so on. Over and over and over again.

        //2) The forloop provider is not guaranteed to maintain a relationship between forloop index and underlying hardware threads across multiple dispatches.
        //In fact, we should expect the opposite. Work stealing is an important feature for threadpools to avoid pointless idle time.
        //Unfortunately, this can destroy potential cache locality across solver iterations. This matters only a little bit for smaller simulations on a single processor-
        //if a single core's solver iteration data can fit in L2, then having 'sticky' scheduling will help over multiple iterations. For a 256 KiB per-core L2,
        //that would be a simulation of only about 700 big constraints per core. (That is actually quite a few back in BEPUphysics v1 land... not so much in v2.)

        //Sticky scheduling becomes more important when talking about larger simulations. Consider L3; an 8 MiB L3 cache can hold over 20000 heavy constraints
        //worth of solver iteration data. This is usually shared across all cores of a processor, so the stickiness isn't always useful. However, consider
        //a multiprocessor system. When there are multiple processors, there are multiple L3 caches. Limiting the amount of communication between processors
        //(and to potentially remote parts of system memory) is important, since those accesses tend to have longer latency and lower total bandwidth than direct L3 accesses.
        //But you don't have to resort to big servers to see something like this- some processors, notably the recent Ryzen line, actually behave a bit like 
        //multiple processors that happen to be stuck on the same chip. If the application requires tons of intercore communication, performance will suffer.
        //And of course, cache misses just suck.

        //3) Work stealing implementations that lack application knowledge will tend to make a given worker operate across noncontiguous regions, harming locality and forcing cache misses.

        //So what do we do? We have special guarantees:
        //1) We have to do a bunch of solver iterations in sequence, covering the exact same data over and over. Even the prestep and warmstart cover a lot of the same data.
        //2) We can control the dispatch sizes within a frame. They're going to be the same, over and over, and the next dispatch follows immediately after the last.
        //3) We can guarantee that individual work blocks are fairly small. (A handful of microseconds.)

        //So, there's a few parts to the solution as implemented:
        //1) Dispatch *once* and perform fine grained synchronization with busy waits to block at constraint batch borders. Unless the operating system
        //reschedules a thread (which is very possible, but not a constant occurrence), a worker index will stay associated with the same underlying hardware.
        //2) Worker start locations are spaced across the work blocks so that each worker has a high probability of claiming multiple blocks contiguously.
        //3) Workers track the largest contiguous region that they've been able to claim within an iteration. This is used to provide the next iteration a better starting guess.

        //So, for the most part, the same core/processor will tend to work on the same data over the course of the solve. Hooray!

        //A couple of notes:
        //1) We explicitly don't care about maintaining worker-data relationships between frames. The cache will likely be trashed by the rest of the program- even other parts
        //of the physics simulation will evict stuff. We're primarily concerned about scheduling within the solver.
        //2) Note that neither the prestep nor the warmstart are used to modify the work distribution for the solve- neither of those stages is proportional to the solve iteration load.

        //3) Core-data stickiness doesn't really offer much value for L1/L2 caches. It doesn't take much to evict the entirety of the old data- a 3770K only holds 256KB in its L2.
        //Even if we optimized every constraint to require no more than 350B per iteration for the heaviest constraint 
        //(when this was written, it was at 602B per iteration), a single core's L2 could only hold up to about 750 constraints. 
        //So, the 3770K under ideal circumstances would avoid evicting on a per-iteration basis if the simulation had a total of less than 3000 such constraints.
        //A single thread of a 3700K at 4.5ghz could do prestep-warmstart-8iterations for that in ~2.6 milliseconds. In other words, it's a pretty small simulation.

        //Sticky scheduling only becomes more useful when dealing with multiprocessor systems (or multiprocessor-ish systems, like ryzen) and big datasets, like you might find in an MMO server.
        //A 3770K has 8MB of L3 cache shared across all cores, enough to hold a little under 24000 large constraint solves worth of data between iterations, which is a pretty large chunk.
        //If you had four similar processors, you could ideally handle almost 100,000 constraints without suffering significant evictions in each processor's L3 during iterations.
        //Without sticky scheduling, memory bandwidth use could skyrocket during iterations as the L3 gets missed over and over.
