            //There are some very interesting tricks you can use here, though.
            //Our core tuning variables are the damping ratio and natural frequency.
            //Our runtime used variables are softness and an error reduction feedback scale..
            //(For the following, I'll use the ODE terms CFM and ERP, constraint force mixing and error reduction parameter.)
            //So first, we need to get from damping ratio and natural frequency to stiffness and damping spring constants.
            //From there, we'll go to CFM/ERP.
            //Then, we'll create an expression for a softened effective mass matrix (i.e. one that takes into account the CFM term),
            //and an expression for the contraint force mixing term in the solve iteration.
            //Finally, compute ERP.
            //(And then some tricks.)

            //1) Convert from damping ratio and natural frequency to stiffness and damping constants.
            //The raw expressions are:
            //stiffness = effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2
            //damping = effectiveMass * 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency
            //Rather than using any single object as the reference for the 'mass' term involved in this conversion, use the effective mass of the constraint.
            //In other words, we're dynamically picking the spring constants necessary to achieve the desired behavior for the current constraint configuration.
            //(See Erin Catto's presentation above for more details on this.)

            //(Note that this is different from BEPUphysics v1. There, users configured stiffness and damping constants. That worked okay, but people often got confused about
            //why constraints didn't behave the same when they changed masses. Usually it manifested as someone creating an incredibly high mass object relative to the default
            //stiffness/damping, and they'd post on the forum wondering why constraints were so soft. Basically, the defaults were another sneaky tuning factor to get wrong.
            //Since damping ratio and natural frequency define the behavior independent of the mass, this problem goes away- and it makes some other interesting things happen...)

            //2) Convert from stiffness and damping constants to CFM and ERP.
            //CFM = (stiffness * dt + damping)^-1
            //ERP = (stiffness * dt) * (stiffness * dt + damping)^-1
            //Or, to rephrase:
            //ERP = (stiffness * dt) * CFM

            //3) Use CFM and ERP to create a softened effective mass matrix and a force mixing term for the solve iterations.
            //Start with a base definition which we won't be deriving, the velocity constraint itself (stated as an equality constraint here):
            //This means 'world space velocity projected into constraint space should equal the velocity bias term combined with the constraint force mixing term'.
            //(The velocity bias term will be computed later- it's the position error scaled by the error reduction parameter, ERP. Position error is used to create a velocity motor goal.)
            //We're pulling back from the implementation of sequential impulses here, so rather than using the term 'accumulated impulse', we'll use 'lambda'
            //(which happens to be consistent with the ODE documentation covering the same topic). Lambda is impulse that satisfies the constraint.
            //wsv * JT = bias - lambda * CFM/dt
            //This can be phrased as:
            //currentVelocity = targetVelocity
            //Or:
            //goalVelocityChange = targetVelocity - currentVelocity
            //lambda = goalVelocityChange * effectiveMass
            //lambda = (targetVelocity - currentVelocity) * effectiveMass
            //lambda = (bias - lambda * CFM/dt - currentVelocity) * effectiveMass
            //Solving for lambda:
            //lambda = (bias - currentVelocity) * effectiveMass - lambda * CFM/dt * effectiveMass
            //lambda + lambda * CFM/dt * effectiveMass = (bias - currentVelocity) * effectiveMass 
            //(lambda + lambda * CFM/dt * effectiveMass) * effectiveMass^-1 = bias - currentVelocity
            //lambda * effectiveMass^-1 + lambda * CFM/dt = bias - currentVelocity
            //lambda * (effectiveMass^-1 + CFM/dt) = bias - currentVelocity
            //lambda = (bias - currentVelocity) * (effectiveMass^-1 + CFM/dt)^-1
            //lambda = (bias - wsv * JT) * (effectiveMass^-1 + CFM/dt)^-1
            //In other words, we transform the velocity change (bias - wsv * JT) into the constraint-satisfying impulse, lambda, using a matrix (effectiveMass^-1 + CFM/dt)^-1.
            //That matrix is the softened effective mass:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + CFM/dt)^-1

            //Here's where some trickiness occurs. (Be mindful of the distinction between the softened and unsoftened effective mass).
            //Start by substituting CFM into the softened effective mass definition:
            //CFM/dt = (stiffness * dt + damping)^-1 / dt = (dt * (stiffness * dt + damping))^-1 = (stiffness * dt^2 + damping*dt)^-1
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + (stiffness * dt^2 + damping * dt)^-1)^-1
            //Now substitute the definitions of stiffness and damping, treating the scalar components as uniform scaling matrices of dimension equal to effectiveMass:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + ((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt^2 + (effectiveMass * 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency) * dt)^-1)^-1
            //Combine the inner effectiveMass coefficients, given matrix multiplication distributes over addition:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + (effectiveMass * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2) + effectiveMass * (2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt))^-1)^-1
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + (effectiveMass * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt))^-1)^-1
            //Apply the inner matrix inverse:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = (effectiveMass^-1 + (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1 * effectiveMass^-1)^-1
            //Once again, combine coefficients of the inner effectiveMass^-1 terms:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = ((1 + (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1) * effectiveMass^-1)^-1
            //Apply the inverse again:
            //softenedEffectiveMass = effectiveMass * (1 + (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1)^-1

            //So, to put it another way- because CFM is based on the effective mass, applying it to the effective mass results in a simple downscale.

            //What has been gained? Consider what happens in the solve iteration.
            //We take the velocity error:
            //velocityError = bias - accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt - wsv * JT 
            //and convert it to a corrective impulse with the effective mass:
            //impulse = (bias - accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt - wsv * JT) * softenedEffectiveMass
            //The effective mass distributes over the set:
            //impulse = bias * softenedEffectiveMass - accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt * softenedEffectiveMass - wsv * JT * softenedEffectiveMass
            //Focus on the CFM term:
            //-accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt * softenedEffectiveMass
            //What is CFM/dt * softenedEffectiveMass? Substitute.
            //(stiffness * dt^2 + damping * dt)^-1 * softenedEffectiveMass
            //((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt^2 + (effectiveMass * 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt))^-1 * softenedEffectiveMass
            //Combine terms: 
            //(effectiveMass * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt))^-1 * softenedEffectiveMass
            //Apply inverse:
            //(naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1 * effectiveMass^-1 * softenedEffectiveMass
            //Expand softened effective mass from earlier:
            //(naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1 * effectiveMass^-1 * effectiveMass * (1 + (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1)^-1
            //Cancel effective masses: (!)
            //(naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1 * (1 + (naturalFrequency^2 * dt^2 + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency * dt)^-1)^-1
            //Because CFM was created from effectiveMass, the CFM/dt * effectiveMass term is actually independent of the effectiveMass!
            //The remaining expression is still a matrix, but fortunately it is a simple uniform scaling matrix that we can store and apply as a single scalar.

            //4) How do you compute ERP?
            //ERP = (stiffness * dt) * CFM
            //ERP = (stiffness * dt) * (stiffness * dt + damping)^-1
            //ERP = ((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt) * ((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt + (effectiveMass * 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency))^-1
            //Combine denominator terms:
            //ERP = ((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt) * ((effectiveMass * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency))^-1
            //Apply denominator inverse:
            //ERP = ((effectiveMass * naturalFrequency^2) * dt) * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency)^-1 * effectiveMass^-1
            //Uniform scaling matrices commute:
            //ERP = (naturalFrequency^2 * dt) * effectiveMass * effectiveMass^-1 * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency)^-1
            //Cancellation!
            //ERP = (naturalFrequency^2 * dt) * (naturalFrequency^2 * dt + 2 * dampingRatio * naturalFrequency)^-1
            //ERP = (naturalFrequency * dt) * (naturalFrequency * dt + 2 * dampingRatio)^-1
            //ERP is a simple scalar, independent of mass.

            //5) So we can compute CFM, ERP, the softened effective mass matrix, and we have an interesting shortcut on the constraint force mixing term of the solve iterations.
            //Is there anything more that can be done? You bet!
            //Let's look at the post-distribution impulse computation again:
            //impulse = bias * effectiveMass - accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt * effectiveMass - wsv * JT * effectiveMass
            //During the solve iterations, the only quantities that vary are the accumulated impulse and world space velocities. So the rest can be precomputed.
            //bias * effectiveMass,
            //CFM/dt * effectiveMass,
            //JT * effectiveMass
            //In other words, we bypass the intermediate velocity state and go directly from source velocities to an impulse.
            //Note the sizes of the precomputed types above:
            //bias * effective mass is the same size as bias (vector with dimension equal to constrained DOFs)
            //CFM/dt * effectiveMass is a single scalar regardless of constrained DOFs,
            //JT * effectiveMass is the same size as JT
            //But note that we no longer need to load the effective mass! It is implicit.
            //The resulting computation is:
            //impulse = a - accumulatedImpulse * b - wsv * c
            //two DOF-width adds (add/subtract), one DOF-width multiply, and a 1xDOF * DOFx12 jacobian-sized transform.
            //Compare to;
            //(bias - accumulatedImpulse * CFM/dt - wsv * JT) * effectiveMass
            //two DOF-width adds (add/subtract), one DOF width multiply, a 1xDOF * DOFx12 jacobian-sized transform, and a 1xDOF * DOFxDOF transform.
            //In other words, we shave off a whole 1xDOF * DOFxDOF transform per iteration.
            //So, taken in isolation, this is a strict win both in terms of memory and the amount of computation.

            //Unfortunately, it's not quite so simple- jacobians are ALSO used to transform the impulse into world space so that it can be used to change the body velocities.
            //We still need to have those around. So while we no longer store the effective mass, our jacobian has sort of been duplicated.
            //But wait, there's more!

            //That process looks like:
            //wsv += impulse * J * M^-1
            //So while we need to store something here, we can take advantage of the fact that we aren't using the jacobian anywhere else (it's replaced by the JT * effectiveMass term above).
            //Precompute J*M^-1, too.
            //So you're still loading a jacobian-sized matrix, but you don't need to load M^-1! That saves you 14 scalars. (symmetric 3x3 + 1 + symmetric 3x3 + 1)
            //That saves you the multiplication of (impulse * J) * M^-1, which is 6 multiplies and 6 dot products.

            //Note that this optimization's value depends on the number of constrained DOFs.

            //Net memory change, opt vs no opt, in scalars:
            //1DOF: costs 1x12, saves 1x1 effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: -3
            //2DOF: costs 2x12, saves 2x2 symmetric effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: 7
            //3DOF: costs 3x12, saves 3x3 symmetric effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: 16
            //4DOF: costs 4x12, saves 4x4 symmetric effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: 24
            //5DOF: costs 5x12, saves 5x5 symmetric effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: 31
            //6DOF: costs 6x12, saves 6x6 symmetric effective mass and the 14 scalar M^-1: 37

            //Net compute savings, opt vs no opt:
            //DOF savings = 1xDOF * DOFxDOF (DOF DOFdot products), 2 1x3 * scalar (6 multiplies), 2 1x3 * 3x3 (6 3dot products)
            //            = (DOF*DOF multiplies + DOF*(DOF-1) adds) + (6 multiplies) + (18 multiplies + 12 adds)
            //            = DOF*DOF + 24 multiplies, DOF*DOF-DOF + 12 adds
            //1DOF: 25 multiplies, 12 adds
            //2DOF: 28 multiplies, 14 adds
            //3DOF: 33 multiplies, 18 adds
            //4DOF: 40 multiplies, 24 adds
            //5DOF: 49 multiplies, 32 adds
            //6DOF: 60 multiplies, 42 adds

            //So does our 'optimization' actually do anything useful? 
            //In 1 DOF constraints, it's often a win with no downsides.
            //2+ are difficult to determine.
            //This depends on heavily on the machine's SIMD width. You do every lane's ALU ops in parallel, but the loads are still fundamentally bound by memory bandwidth.
            //The loads are coherent, at least- no gathers on this stuff. But I wouldn't be surprised if 3DOF+ constraints end up being faster *without* the pretransformations on wide SIMD.
            //This is just something that will require case by case analysis. Constraints can have special structure which change the judgment.

            //(Also, note that large DOF jacobians are often very sparse. Consider the jacobians used by a 6DOF weld joint. You could likely do special case optimizations to reduce the
            //load further. It is unlikely that you could find a way to do the same to JT * effectiveMass. J * M^-1 might have some savings, though. But J*M^-1 isn't *sparser*
            //than J by itself, so the space savings are limited. As long as you precompute, the above load requirement offset will persist.)

            //Good news, though! There are a lot of constraints where this trick is applicable.

            //We'll start with the unsoftened effective mass, constructed from the contributions computed above:
            var effectiveMass = Vector<float>.One / (linearA + linearB + angularA + angularB);
