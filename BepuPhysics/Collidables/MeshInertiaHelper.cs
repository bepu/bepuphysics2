            //Computing the inertia of a tetrahedron requires integrating across its volume.
            //While it's possible to do so directly given arbitrary plane equations, it's more convenient to integrate over a normalized tetrahedron with coordinates 
            //at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The integration location can be transformed back to the original frame of reference using the tetrahedral edges.
            //That is, (1,0,0) in normalized space transforms to B-A in world space.
            //To make that explicit, we have an equation:
            // [1,0,0]               [ B - A ]
            // [0,1,0] * Transform = [ C - A ]
            // [0,0,1]               [ D - A ]
            //(Note that you could consider this to be an affine transform with a translation equal to A.)

            //Since the normalized edge directions compose the identity matrix, the transform is just the edge directions.
            //So, given function f that computes a point's contribution to the inertia tensor, the inertia tensor of the normalized tetrahedron with uniform unit density is:
            //Integrate[Integrate[Integrate[f[{i, j, k}], {k, 0, 1-i-j}], {j, 0, 1-i}], {i, 0, 1}];
            //Note the integration bounds- they are a result of the simple shape of the normalized tetrahedron making the plane equations easier to deal with.
            //Now, to integrate over the true tetrahedron's shape, the normalized coordinates are transformed to world coordinates:
            //Integrate[Integrate[Integrate[f[{i, j, k}.Transform + A] * Abs[Det[Transform]], {k, 0, 1-i-j}], {j, 0, 1-i}], {i, 0, 1}];

            //One key difference is the inclusion of the transform's jacobian's determinant, which in this case is just the volume of the tetrahedron times six.
            //For a geometric intuition for why that exists, consider that the normalized integration covers a tetrahedron with a volume of 1/6. The world space tetrahedron
            //has a volume of Abs[Det[Transform]]/6. So, the volume changes by a factor of exactly Abs[Det[Transform]]. 
            //That term compensates for the difference in integration domain.
            //It's also constant over the integration, so you can just pull it out.
            //Similarly, if you had a non-unit uniform density, you would multiply the integration by it too.
