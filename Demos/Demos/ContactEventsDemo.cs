    //Bepuphysics v2 doesn't have any concept of 'events'. It has callbacks that report the current status of contact manifolds.
    //Events can be built around those callbacks. This demo shows one way of doing that.

    //It's worth noting a few things about this event handler approach:
    //1) It's a little nonidiomatic, since there are no actual C# 'events' being used. An interface is invoked instead. This preserves the generic manifold type.
    //You could shuffle things around a bit and invoke delegates for a more event-ish workflow, or even function pointers if you wanted to jump through some hoops.
    //2) All event handlers (except OnPairEnded) potentially execute from the multithreaded context of the simulation execution, so you have to be careful about what the event handlers do.
    //A "deferred" event model could be built on top of this.
    //3) Event handling isn't free; try to avoid attaching events to everything if you can avoid it, and try to make the event handlers as cheap as possible.
    //4) This provides no insight into the constraints associated with these contacts. For example, if you want to spawn particles in response to heavy collisions or play sounds
    //with volume dependent on the impact force, you will need to go pull impulse data from the solver. Further, those sorts of use cases often only apply to nearby objects,
    //so a listener based model isn't ideal. Instead, querying nearby active objects and examining their contact constraints would be much more direct.
    //5) Contacts can be created speculatively. A contact existing does not guarantee a nonnegative penetration depth!
    //Note that only manifolds with contacts with nonnegative depths are reported as 'touching' below.
    //6) On the flipside of #6, an impact is not guaranteed to always have a nonnegative penetration depth at some point!
    //Solving the constraints associated with speculative contacts could end up bouncing an object off a surface between two collision detection runs that both show negative depth.
    //7) There are other ways of pulling contact data. For example, check out the SolverContactEnumerationDemo which pulls data from the solver constraints created from contacts.
    //Pulling accumulated impulses from the solver is one way to never miss an actual collision; if the contact constraints applied any force, then there must have been an impact.
    //8) Pairs involving two sleeping bodies will not generate events. That means OnTouching and OnPairUpdated will not fire for sleeping pairs.
