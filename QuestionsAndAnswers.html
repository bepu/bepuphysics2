<h2 id="im-seeing-spikes-in-the-time-it-takes-to-simulate-a-timestep-whats-going-on">I'm seeing spikes in the time it takes to simulate a timestep, what's going on?</h2>
<p>If it quits happening a little while after application startup, it's probably JIT compilation. You could consider warming up the simulation so all the relevant codepaths are seen by the JIT ahead of time. You may also want to look into ahead of time compilation like NativeAOT.</p>
<p>If it keeps happening, and the spikes are in the range of a handful of milliseconds, the operating system might be struggling with a bunch of threads competing for timeslices, resulting in stalls. In that case, try using fewer threads for the physics- leaving one free might be all it takes. See the <a href="PerformanceTips.html#general">Performance Tips</a> for more.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-make-a-convex-shape-rotate-around-a-point-other-than-its-volumetric-center">How can I make a convex shape rotate around a point other than its volumetric center?</h2>
<p>Other than triangles, all convex shapes are centered on their volumetric center, and there is no property in the <code>CollidableDescription</code> to offset a body's shape.</p>
<p>However, you can create a <code>Compound</code> with just one child and give that child an offset local pose. The overhead is pretty tiny.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-make-an-object-that-cant-be-moved-by-outside-influences-like-other-colliding-dynamic-bodies-but-can-still-have-a-velocity">How do I make an object that can't be moved by outside influences, like other colliding dynamic bodies, but can still have a velocity?</h2>
<p>Use a kinematic body. To create one, use <code>BodyDescription.CreateKinematic</code> or set the inverse mass and all components of the inverse inertia to zero in the <code>BodyDescription</code> passed to <code>Simulation.Bodies.Add</code>. Kinematic bodies have effectively infinite mass and cannot be moved by any force. You can still change their velocity directly, though.</p>
<p>Any nonzero component in the inverse mass or inverse inertia results in a dynamic body.</p>
<p>Be careful when using kinematics- they are both unstoppable forces and immovable objects. If a dynamic body gets caught between a kinematic body and the static environment, there's a good chance the dynamic body will get pushed out of the level!</p>
<p>Also, if two kinematic bodies collide, a constraint will not be generated. Kinematics cannot respond to collisions, not even with other infinitely massive objects. They will simply continue to move along the path defined by their velocity.</p>
<h2 id="the-heck-is-a-speculative-marginspeculative-contact">The heck is a 'speculative margin'/'speculative contact'?</h2>
<p>A way of solving for predicted collisions to stop penetration and tunneling. See the <a href="ContinuousCollisionDetection.html">continuous collision detection documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="i-made-a-body-with-zero-inverse-mass-and-nonzero-inverse-inertia-and-the-simulation-explodedcrashed-why">I made a body with zero inverse mass and nonzero inverse inertia and the simulation exploded/crashed! Why?</h2>
<p>While dynamic bodies with zero inverse mass and nonzero inverse inertia tensors are technically allowed, they require extreme care. It is possible for constraints to be configured such that there is no solution, resulting in a division by zero. <code>NaN</code> values will propagate through the simulation and make everything explode.</p>
<p>To avoid the <code>NaN</code>-explosion, any constraint involving two bodies must be able to compute some local solution. For example, if two bodies have zero inverse mass but nonzero inverse inertia, you could create a ball socket joint that avoids issues by ensuring that the anchor offsets are nonzero.</p>
<p>This is harder to guarantee in the general case. Consider collision constraints created between the same two bodies. If a contact is created with zero offset from the object's center to the contact position, there will be no angular contribution to the constraint. Since the inverse masses are both zero, no local solution exists and a portal to NaNland will open.</p>
<p>Generally, avoid creating dynamic bodies with zero inverse mass unless you can absolutely guarantee that the involved constraints will never become degenerate. For example, if collisions are disabled, you don't have to worry about the automatically generated contact constraints, and you can tightly control what other constraints exist.</p>
<p>(You can also just use a constraint to keep an object positioned in one spot rather than setting its inverse mass to zero!)</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-ensure-that-the-results-of-a-simulation-are-deterministic-given-the-same-inputs-the-simulation-produces-the-same-physical-result-on-a-single-machine">How can I ensure that the results of a simulation are deterministic (given the same inputs, the simulation produces the same physical result) on a single machine?</h2>
<p>Take great care to ensure that every interaction with the physics simulation is reproduced in exactly the same order on each execution. This even includes the order of adds and removes!</p>
<p>Assuming that all external interactions with the engine are deterministic, the simulation is deterministic on a single machine when one of two conditions is met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The simulation runs with only a single thread (that is, no <code>IThreadDispatcher</code> is provided to the time step function).</li>
<li>The simulation is provided multiple threads and the <code>Simulation.Deterministic</code> property is set to true.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Deterministic</code> property defaults to false. Ensuring determinism has a slight performance impact. It should be trivial for most simulations, but large and extremely chaotic simulations may take a noticeable hit.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-want-determinism-across-different-computers">What do I do if I want determinism across different computers?</h2>
<p>Hope that they happen to have exactly the same architecture so that every single instruction produces bitwise identical results. :(</p>
<p>If the target hardware is known to be identical (maybe a networked console game where users only play against other users of the exact same hardware), you might be fine. Sometimes, you'll even get lucky and end up with two different desktop processors that produce identical results.</p>
<p>But, in general, the only way to guarantee cross platform determinism is to avoid generating any instructions which may differ between hardware. A common solution here is to use software floating point or fixed point rather than native floating point math.</p>
<p>At the moment, BEPUphysics v2 does not support software floats or fixed math out of the box, and it would be a pretty enormous undertaking to port it all over without destroying performance.</p>
<p>I may try to get something working here in the future. I can't guarantee when or if I'll get around to it, though; don't wait for me!</p>
<h2 id="i-updated-to-the-latest-version-of-the-physics-library-and-simulations-are-producing-different-results-than-before-even-though-i-set-the-simulationdeterministic-property-to-true-what-do">I updated to the latest version of the physics library and simulations are producing different results than before, even though I set the <code>Simulation.Deterministic</code> property to true! What do?</h2>
<p>Different versions of the library are not guaranteed to produce identical simulation results. Guaranteeing cross-version determinism would constrain development to an unacceptable degree.</p>
<p>If you need determinism of results over long periods (for example, storing game replays for later viewing), it's typically easiest to just fall back to something like storing keyframed animation. You can still use the simulation to help fill out details if you'd like- similar to a networked game receiving sparse updates from a server and filling in the details with extrapolated local simulation. There just has to be a way to correct for the gradual drift.</p>
<p>Such a drift correcting mechanism also compensates for the differences between processor architectures, so you'd gain the ability to share the replay across different hardware as a bonus.</p>
<h2 id="i-was-trying-to-simulate-the-behavior-of-a-spinning-multitool-in-zero-gravity-and-noted-a-clear-lack-of-the-dzhanibekov-effect">I was trying to simulate the behavior of a spinning multitool in zero gravity and noted a CLEAR lack of the Dzhanibekov effect!</h2>
<p>By default, angular momentum is not explicitly tracked; angular velocity will remain constant during rotation without outside impulses.</p>
<p>Momentum-conserving angular integration can be chosen by returning a different value from the <code>IPoseIntegratorCallbacks.AngularIntegrationMode</code> property. Gyroscopes tend to work better with <code>ConserveMomentum</code>, while <code>ConserveMomentumWithGyroscopicTorque</code> is less prone to velocity drift toward lower inertia axes.</p>
<h1 id="surprises">Surprises</h1>
<p>Simulating real physics is slightly difficult, so corners are cut. Lots of corners. Sometimes this results in unexpected behavior. Sometimes different physics libraries cut different corners, so the unexpected behavior differs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to meet certain use cases or performance requirements, the API ends up looking a little unintuitive- especially from an object oriented background.</p>
<p>This is a list of some things that might frustrate or raise an eyebrow (and what to do about them, where applicable).</p>
<p>This list will probably change over time.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-bouncinessrestitution-material-property">...Where is the bounciness/restitution material property?</h2>
<p>You're not crazy- it doesn't exist! Instead, at the time of writing, there is friction, frequency, damping ratio, and maximum recovery velocity.</p>
<p>Frequency and damping ratio can achieve some of the same effects as restitution with a bit of configuration. Check out the <a 
        $match = $args[0]
        $originalLink = $args[0].Groups[1].Value
        # Remove the "../" prefix for the GitHub URL
        $relativePath = $originalLink -replace '^\.\.\/', ''
        "href=`"$repoUrl/$relativePath`""
    >BouncinessDemo</a> for an example.</p>
<p>The reason for the lack of a traditional coefficient of restitution is speculative contacts. v1 used them too, but v2 pushes their usage much further and uses them as the primary form of continuous collision detection. Most of the problems caused by speculative contacts (like ghost contacts) have been smoothed over, but the naive implementation of velocity-flip restitution simply doesn't work with speculative contacts.</p>
<h2 id="swept-shape-tests-against-the-backfaces-of-meshes-dont-go-through-but-collisions-do-whats-going-on">Swept shape tests against the backfaces of meshes don't go through, but collisions do. What's going on?</h2>
<p>While ray and collision testing against triangles is always one sided, swept shape tests are double sided. This is pretty strange, and there isn't a secret good reason for it.</p>
<p>The not-great reason for it is that shape sweep tests use a root finder operating on top of a distance tester subroutine to support angular motion. One sided triangles make this much more complicated, and I haven't gotten around to building an efficient dedicated implementation.</p>
<p>This isn't a top priority for now since sweeps against the back faces of meshes should be pretty rare in practice. If you've got a use case where this addressing this inconsistency is critical, open an issue- but I can't guarantee a fix.</p>
